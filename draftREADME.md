  ## Description
  For demonstrating what an unedited generated Readme looks like.

  ## Installation
  Extra steps include requiring node js and the npm Inquirer package, version 8.2.4

  ## Usage
  In your command terminal, type "node {file-path}". In this case, it's easiest to type "node index", and then hit tab to auto complete the path. You will then be prompted with a series of questions. Answer each question about the application. The final question will be a list of Licenses. Choose the correct license. If your license is not present, you can select the last option that there is no license, and then you will be able to enter the license information manually once the readme is generated. It will be generated under the file name draft README.MD.
